    <p>I live in Turkey and love ordering haydari at restaurants or picking it up from the deli section at the market. It is a thick and tangy Turkish yogurt dip best served with meat kebab and pita bread. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container plain yogurt </li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt </li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh dill, chopped </li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped </li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 mint leaves, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a colander with two layers of cheesecloth and place over a medium bowl. Place the yogurt on the cheesecloth and cover the colander with plastic wrap. Allow yogurt to drain 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Scoop the drained yogurt into a mixing bowl. Mash the garlic cloves with the salt into a fine paste; mix into the yogurt. Stir the dill, parsley, and cream cheese into the yogurt and garlic mixture. Spread onto a dish and garnish with the mint leaves to serve.</li>
